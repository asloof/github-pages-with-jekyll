# Welcome to my blog page!

Just trying to create a homepage for right now. :smirk:


I'm still learning, often referencing [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
- Pull Requests
- Customizing the site
- Adding metadata
- Merging a blog post
- Correct Errors
